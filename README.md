## üéØ Overview

CodeDeck transforms your LeetCode practice into an organized, trackable experience. Instead of losing track of problems you've worked on, CodeDeck lets you:

- **Organize problems as flashcards** with descriptions, tricks, and personal notes
- **Track your coding attempts** with automatic Git integration
- **Store and view your Python solutions** with syntax highlighting
- **Mark problems as solved** and track your progress

## üìã Prerequisites

Before installing CodeDeck, ensure you have:

1. **Docker and Docker Compose** installed on your system
2. **Git** installed and configured
3. **GitHub Personal Access Token** with repository permissions
4. **A Git repository** for storing your LeetCode attempts

## üöÄ Installation

### First-Time Setup

CodeDeck requires a **separate Git repository** to store your LeetCode attempt files. This is where your Python solutions will be automatically committed and tracked.

#### Step 1: Prepare Your Attempts Repository

**Create a new Git repository for your LeetCode attempts:**

```bash
# Create a new directory for your attempts
mkdir my-leetcode-attempts
cd my-leetcode-attempts

# Initialize as Git repository
git init

# Create initial commit
echo "# My LeetCode Attempts" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add remote (replace with your GitHub repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-leetcode-attempts.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Important**: 
- This repository is **separate** from the CodeDeck application
- CodeDeck will create files like `attempts/problem-1/attempt.py` in this repository
- Each attempt gets automatically committed and pushed to this repository

#### Step 2: Get GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "CodeDeck Access"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** - you'll need it in the next step

#### Step 3: Install CodeDeck

```bash
# Clone CodeDeck application
git clone https://github.com/siddsabata/codedeck.git
cd codedeck

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env
```

#### Step 4: Configure Environment

Edit `.env` with your actual values:

```bash
# Database (leave as-is)
DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/dev.db"

# Your GitHub Personal Access Token (from Step 2)
GITHUB_PAT="ghp_your_actual_token_here"

# ABSOLUTE path to your attempts repository (from Step 1)
GIT_REPO_PATH="/Users/yourusername/my-leetcode-attempts"

# Your Git identity for commits
GIT_USER_NAME="Your Full Name"
GIT_USER_EMAIL="your.email@example.com"
```

**Critical**: 
- `GIT_REPO_PATH` must be the **absolute path** to your attempts repository
- Use the full path like `/Users/yourusername/my-leetcode-attempts` (not relative paths)

#### Step 5: Start CodeDeck

```bash
# Start the application (first time will download Docker images)
docker-compose up codedeck-dev
```

Wait for the startup to complete, then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Daily Usage

After the first-time setup, starting CodeDeck is simple:

```bash
# Navigate to CodeDeck directory
cd codedeck

# Start the application
docker-compose up codedeck-dev
```

**That's it!** The application will:
- ‚úÖ Start the web interface at http://localhost:3000
- ‚úÖ Connect to your attempts repository
- ‚úÖ Be ready to track your LeetCode solutions

### Stopping the Application

To stop CodeDeck when you're done:

```bash
# If running in foreground (you see logs), press:
Ctrl + C

# If running in background, stop with:
docker-compose down
```

The application will shut down gracefully and your data will be preserved.

### How It Works

1. **You solve a LeetCode problem** on leetcode.com
2. **You create a problem card** in CodeDeck with the problem details
3. **You add an attempt** by pasting your Python solution
4. **CodeDeck automatically**:
   - Creates `attempts/problem-X/attempt.py` in your attempts repository
   - Commits the file with a descriptive message
   - Pushes to your GitHub repository
   - Tracks the commit hash for viewing later

### Troubleshooting

**"Git repository not found"**: 
- Verify `GIT_REPO_PATH` is the absolute path to your attempts repository
- Make sure the directory exists and is a Git repository (`git status` should work)

**"Authentication failed"**: 
- Check your `GITHUB_PAT` is correct and has `repo` permissions
- Ensure your attempts repository remote URL is correct

**"Permission denied"**: 
- Make sure Docker can access your attempts repository directory
- On macOS/Linux, the path should be under your home directory

For detailed Docker troubleshooting, see [README-DOCKER.md](README-DOCKER.md).
